  abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the predominant RCC subtype, but even within this classification, the natural history is heterogeneous and difficult to predict. A sophisticated understanding of the molecular features most discriminatory for the underlying tumor heterogeneity should be predicated on identifiable and biologically meaningful patterns of gene expression. Gene expression microarray data were analyzed using software that implements iterative unsupervised consensus clustering algorithms to identify the optimal molecular subclasses, without clinical or other classifying information. ConsensusCluster analysis identified two distinct subtypes of ccRCC within the training set, designated clear cell type A (ccA) and B (ccB). Based on the core tumors, or most well-defined arrays, in each subtype, logical analysis of data (LAD) defined a small, highly predictive gene set that could then be used to classify additional tumors individually. The subclasses were corroborated in a validation data set of 177 tumors and analyzed for clinical outcome. Based on individual tumor assignment, tumors designated ccA have markedly improved disease-specific survival compared to ccB (median survival of 8.6 vs 2.0 years, P = 0.002). Analyzed by both univariate and multivariate analysis, the classification schema was independently associated with survival. Using patterns of gene expression based on a defined gene set, ccRCC was classified into two robust subclasses based on inherent molecular features that ultimately correspond to marked differences in clinical outcome. This classification schema thus provides a molecular stratification applicable to individual tumors that has implications to influence treatment decisions, define biological mechanisms involved in ccRCC tumor progression, and direct future drug discovery.},

  abstract = {Context Dramatic gains in our understanding of the molecular biology of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have created a foundation for clinical translation to improve patient care. Objective To review and contextualize clinically impactful data surrounding genomic biomarkers in ccRCC. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature search was conducted focusing on genomic-based biomarkers with an emphasis on studies assessing clinical outcomes. Evidence synthesis The advancement of tumor sequencing techniques has led to a rapid increase in the knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of ccRCC and with that the discovery of multiple candidate genomic biomarkers. These include somatic gene mutations such as VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, and BAP1; copy number variations; transcriptomic multigene signatures; and specific immune cell populations. Many of these biomarkers have been assessed for their association with survival and a smaller number as potential predictors of a response to systemic therapy. In this scoping review, we discuss many of these biomarkers in detail. Further studies are needed to continue to refine and validate these molecular tools for risk stratification, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. Conclusions While no tissue or blood-based biomarkers for ccRCC have been incorporated into routine clinical practice to date, the field continues to expand rapidly. There remains a critical need to develop and validate these tools in order to improve the care for patients with kidney cancer. Patient summary Genomic biomarkers have the potential to better predict outcome and select the most appropriate treatment for patients with kidney cancer; however, further research is needed before any of these currently developed biomarkers are adopted into clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Genetic changes underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) include alterations in genes controlling cellular oxygen sensing (for example, VHL) and the maintenance of chromatin states (for example, PBRM1). We surveyed more than 400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly mutated genes. The PI(3)K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10. Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease treatment.},

  abstract = {International cancer registries make real-world genomic and clinical data available, but their joint analysis remains a challenge. AACR Project GENIE, an international cancer registry collecting data from 19 cancer centers, makes data from {$>$}130,000 patients publicly available through the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (https://genie.cbioportal.org). For 25,000 patients, additional real-world longitudinal clinical data, including treatment and outcome data, are being collected by the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative using the PRISSMM data curation model. Several thousand of these cases are now also available in cBioPortal. We have significantly enhanced the functionalities of cBioPortal to support the visualization and analysis of this rich clinico-genomic linked dataset, as well as datasets generated by other centers and consortia. Examples of these enhancements include (i) visualization of the longitudinal clinical and genomic data at the patient level, including timelines for diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes; (ii) the ability to select samples based on treatment status, facilitating a comparison of molecular and clinical attributes between samples before and after a specific treatment; and (iii) survival analysis estimates based on individual treatment regimens received. Together, these features provide cBioPortal users with a toolkit to interactively investigate complex clinico-genomic data to generate hypotheses and make discoveries about the impact of specific genomic variants on prognosis and therapeutic sensitivities in cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Enhanced cBioPortal features allow clinicians and researchers to effectively investigate longitudinal clinico-genomic data from patients with cancer, which will improve exploration of data from the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative and similar datasets.},

The portal reduces molecular profiling data from cancer tissues and cell lines into readily understandable genetic, epigenetic, gene expression, and proteomic events. The query interface combined with customized data storage enables researchers to interactively explore genetic alterations across samples, genes, and pathways and, when available in the underlying data, to link these to clinical outcomes. The portal provides graphical summaries of gene-level data from multiple platforms, network visualization and analysis, survival analysis, patient-centric queries, and software programmatic access. The intuitive Web interface of the portal makes complex cancer genomics profiles accessible to researchers and clinicians without requiring bioinformatics expertise, thus facilitating biological discoveries. Here, we provide a practical guide to the analysis and visualization features of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics.},

  abstract = {Renal cell carcinoma: links and risks Reena Kabaria, Zachary Klaassen, Martha K Terris Department of Surgery, Section of Urology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA  Abstract: This review provides an overview of the incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a summary of the most commonly associated risk factors. A literature review was performed with a focus on recent studies with a high level of evidence (large prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses). The incidence rate of RCC varies globally, with the rate rising rapidly in more developed regions, demonstrating the effects of increased use of diagnostic imaging and prevalence of modifiable risk factors. Based on the current evidence, cigarette smoking, obesity, and hypertension are the most well-established risk factors for sporadic RCC worldwide. Acquired cystic kidney disease is also a significant risk factor, specifically in dialysis patients. There is increasing evidence for an inverse association between RCC risk and moderate alcohol consumption. Certain analgesics and occupational exposure have been linked to an increased risk of RCC, although data are limited. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables may provide a protective effect.

  abstract = {There are only a few platforms that integrate multiple omics data types, bioinformatics tools, and interfaces for integrative analyses and visualization that do not require programming skills. Here we present iLINCS (http://ilincs.org), an integrative web-based platform for analysis of omics data and signatures of cellular perturbations. The platform facilitates mining and re-analysis of the large collection of omics datasets ({$>$}34,000), pre-computed signatures ({$>$}200,000), and their connections, as well as the analysis of user-submitted omics signatures of diseases and cellular perturbations. iLINCS analysis workflows integrate vast omics data resources and a range of analytics and interactive visualization tools into a comprehensive platform for analysis of omics signatures. iLINCS user-friendly interfaces enable execution of sophisticated analyses of omics signatures, mechanism of action analysis, and signature-driven drug repositioning. We illustrate the utility of iLINCS with three use cases involving analysis of cancer proteogenomic signatures, COVID 19 transcriptomic signatures and mTOR signaling.},

  abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a malignancy characterized by deregulated hypoxia-inducible factor signaling, mutation of several key chromatin modifying enzymes, and numerous alterations in cellular metabolism. Pre-clinical studies have historically been limited to cell culture models, however, the identification of critical tumor suppressors and oncogenes from large-scale patient sequencing data has led to several new genetically engineered mouse models with phenotypes reminiscent of ccRCC. In this review, we summarize recent literature on these topics and discuss how they inform targeted therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ccRCC.},

  abstract = {The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing worldwide, and its prevalence is particularly high in some parts of Central Europe. Here we undertake whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most common form of the disease, in patients from four different European countries with contrasting disease incidence to explore the underlying genomic architecture of RCC. Our findings support previous reports on frequent aberrations in the epigenetic machinery and PI3K/mTOR signalling, and uncover novel pathways and genes affected by recurrent mutations and abnormal transcriptome patterns including focal adhesion, components of extracellular matrix (ECM) and genes encoding FAT cadherins. Furthermore, a large majority of patients from Romania have an unexpected high frequency of A:T{$>$}T:A transversions, consistent with exposure to aristolochic acid (AA). These results show that the processes underlying ccRCC tumorigenesis may vary in different populations and suggest that AA may be an important ccRCC carcinogen in Romania, a finding with major public health implications.},
