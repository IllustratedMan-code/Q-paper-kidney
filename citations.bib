  abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the predominant RCC subtype, but even within this classification, the natural history is heterogeneous and difficult to predict. A sophisticated understanding of the molecular features most discriminatory for the underlying tumor heterogeneity should be predicated on identifiable and biologically meaningful patterns of gene expression. Gene expression microarray data were analyzed using software that implements iterative unsupervised consensus clustering algorithms to identify the optimal molecular subclasses, without clinical or other classifying information. ConsensusCluster analysis identified two distinct subtypes of ccRCC within the training set, designated clear cell type A (ccA) and B (ccB). Based on the core tumors, or most well-defined arrays, in each subtype, logical analysis of data (LAD) defined a small, highly predictive gene set that could then be used to classify additional tumors individually. The subclasses were corroborated in a validation data set of 177 tumors and analyzed for clinical outcome. Based on individual tumor assignment, tumors designated ccA have markedly improved disease-specific survival compared to ccB (median survival of 8.6 vs 2.0 years, P = 0.002). Analyzed by both univariate and multivariate analysis, the classification schema was independently associated with survival. Using patterns of gene expression based on a defined gene set, ccRCC was classified into two robust subclasses based on inherent molecular features that ultimately correspond to marked differences in clinical outcome. This classification schema thus provides a molecular stratification applicable to individual tumors that has implications to influence treatment decisions, define biological mechanisms involved in ccRCC tumor progression, and direct future drug discovery.},

  abstract = {Inactivation of Polybromo 1 (PBRM1), a specific subunit of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex, occurs frequently in cancer, including 40\% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). To identify novel therapeutic approaches to targeting PBRM1-defective cancers, we used a series of orthogonal functional genomic screens that identified PARP and ATR inhibitors as being synthetic lethal with PBRM1 deficiency. The PBRM1/PARP inhibitor synthetic lethality was recapitulated using several clinical PARP inhibitors in a series of in vitro model systems and in vivo in a xenograft model of ccRCC. In the absence of exogenous DNA damage, PBRM1-defective cells exhibited elevated levels of replication stress, micronuclei, and R-loops. PARP inhibitor exposure exacerbated these phenotypes. Quantitative mass spectrometry revealed that multiple R-loop processing factors were downregulated in PBRM1-defective tumor cells. Exogenous expression of the R-loop resolution enzyme RNase H1 reversed the sensitivity of PBRM1-deficient cells to PARP inhibitors, suggesting that excessive levels of R-loops could be a cause of this synthetic lethality. PARP and ATR inhibitors also induced cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) innate immune signaling in PBRM1-defective tumor cells. Overall, these findings provide the preclinical basis for using PARP inhibitors in PBRM1-defective cancers.This study demonstrates that PARP and ATR inhibitors are synthetic lethal with the loss of PBRM1, a PBAF-specific subunit, thus providing the rationale for assessing these inhibitors in patients with PBRM1-defective cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: System-wide profiling of genes and proteins in mammalian cells produce lists of differentially expressed genes/proteins that need to be further analyzed for their collective functions in order to extract new knowledge. Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for improvement. RESULTS: Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Enrichr is an easy to use intuitive enrichment analysis web-based tool providing various types of visualization summaries of collective functions of gene lists.

  abstract = {Context Dramatic gains in our understanding of the molecular biology of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have created a foundation for clinical translation to improve patient care. Objective To review and contextualize clinically impactful data surrounding genomic biomarkers in ccRCC. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature search was conducted focusing on genomic-based biomarkers with an emphasis on studies assessing clinical outcomes. Evidence synthesis The advancement of tumor sequencing techniques has led to a rapid increase in the knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of ccRCC and with that the discovery of multiple candidate genomic biomarkers. These include somatic gene mutations such as VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, and BAP1; copy number variations; transcriptomic multigene signatures; and specific immune cell populations. Many of these biomarkers have been assessed for their association with survival and a smaller number as potential predictors of a response to systemic therapy. In this scoping review, we discuss many of these biomarkers in detail. Further studies are needed to continue to refine and validate these molecular tools for risk stratification, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. Conclusions While no tissue or blood-based biomarkers for ccRCC have been incorporated into routine clinical practice to date, the field continues to expand rapidly. There remains a critical need to develop and validate these tools in order to improve the care for patients with kidney cancer. Patient summary Genomic biomarkers have the potential to better predict outcome and select the most appropriate treatment for patients with kidney cancer; however, further research is needed before any of these currently developed biomarkers are adopted into clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Genetic changes underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) include alterations in genes controlling cellular oxygen sensing (for example, VHL) and the maintenance of chromatin states (for example, PBRM1). We surveyed more than 400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly mutated genes. The PI(3)K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10. Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease treatment.},

  abstract = {Genetic changes underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) include alterations in genes controlling cellular oxygen sensing (for example, VHL) and the maintenance of chromatin states (for example, PBRM1). We surveyed more than 400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly mutated genes. The PI(3)K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10. Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease treatment.},

The result is consistent that ChRCC originates from the distal nephron compared with other kidney cancers with more proximal origins. Combined mtDNA and gene expression analysis implicates changes in mitochondrial function as a component of the disease biology, while suggesting alternative roles for mtDNA mutations in cancers relying on oxidative phosphorylation. Genomic rearrangements lead to recurrent structural breakpoints within TERT promoter region, which correlates with highly elevated TERT expression and manifestation of kataegis, representing a mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancer distinct from previously observed amplifications and point mutations.},

  abstract = {International cancer registries make real-world genomic and clinical data available, but their joint analysis remains a challenge. AACR Project GENIE, an international cancer registry collecting data from 19 cancer centers, makes data from {$>$}130,000 patients publicly available through the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (https://genie.cbioportal.org). For 25,000 patients, additional real-world longitudinal clinical data, including treatment and outcome data, are being collected by the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative using the PRISSMM data curation model. Several thousand of these cases are now also available in cBioPortal. We have significantly enhanced the functionalities of cBioPortal to support the visualization and analysis of this rich clinico-genomic linked dataset, as well as datasets generated by other centers and consortia. Examples of these enhancements include (i) visualization of the longitudinal clinical and genomic data at the patient level, including timelines for diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes; (ii) the ability to select samples based on treatment status, facilitating a comparison of molecular and clinical attributes between samples before and after a specific treatment; and (iii) survival analysis estimates based on individual treatment regimens received. Together, these features provide cBioPortal users with a toolkit to interactively investigate complex clinico-genomic data to generate hypotheses and make discoveries about the impact of specific genomic variants on prognosis and therapeutic sensitivities in cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Enhanced cBioPortal features allow clinicians and researchers to effectively investigate longitudinal clinico-genomic data from patients with cancer, which will improve exploration of data from the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative and similar datasets.},

  abstract = {Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited autosomal dominant syndrome caused by a germline mutation and/or deletion of the VHL gene. Inappropriate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated transcription of proangiogenic and metabolic genes leads to the development of tumors and cysts in multiple organs. Surgery is a standard treatment for localized tumors with a risk of metastasis or organ dysfunction. Repeated surgeries cause substantial morbidity and have a major impact on quality of life. There is an urgent need to develop effective and safe systemic treatments for VHL disease manifestations. The small-molecule HIF 2 alpha inhibitor MK-6482 (belzutifan) has demonstrated significant efficacy in VHL disease related renal cell carcinomas, hemangioblastomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile. This paper reviews the development of the HIF-2 alpha inhibitor, MK-6482, and discusses preliminary results of ongoing phase I/II studies in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and VHL disease. An examination of ongoing clinical development of MK-6482 and perspectives on potential future developments and challenges are offered. Because of its favorable safety profile, its clear efficacy in VHL disease, promising findings in sporadic, advanced RCC, and convenient oral formulation, MK-6482 is expected to become a leading treatment for VHL disease. Among other currently available oral agents, we believe that MK-6482 will be a preferred treatment for VHL-associated RCC.},

  abstract = {The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway plays a crucial role in various cellular processes and is aberrantly activated in cancers, contributing to the occurrence and progression of tumors. Examining the upstream and downstream nodes of this pathway could allow full elucidation of its function. Based on accumulating evidence, strategies targeting major components of the pathway might provide new insights for cancer drug discovery. Researchers have explored the use of some inhibitors targeting this pathway to block survival pathways. However, because oncogenic PI3K pathway activation occurs through various mechanisms, the clinical efficacies of these inhibitors are limited. Moreover, pathway activation is accompanied by the development of therapeutic resistance. Therefore, strategies involving pathway inhibitors and other cancer treatments in combination might solve the therapeutic dilemma. In this review, we discuss the roles of the PI3K/Akt pathway in various cancer phenotypes, review the current statuses of different PI3K/Akt inhibitors, and introduce combination therapies consisting of signaling inhibitors and conventional cancer therapies. The information presented herein suggests that cascading inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, either alone or in combination with other therapies, are the most effective treatment strategy for cancer.},

A literature review was performed with a focus on recent studies with a high level of evidence (large prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses). The incidence rate of RCC varies globally, with the rate rising rapidly in more developed regions, demonstrating the effects of increased use of diagnostic imaging and prevalence of modifiable risk factors. Based on the current evidence, cigarette smoking, obesity, and hypertension are the most well-established risk factors for sporadic RCC worldwide. Acquired cystic kidney disease is also a significant risk factor, specifically in dialysis patients. There is increasing evidence for an inverse association between RCC risk and moderate alcohol consumption. Certain analgesics and occupational exposure have been linked to an increased risk of RCC, although data are limited. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables may provide a protective effect.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Everolimus (RAD001) is an orally administered inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a therapeutic target for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We did a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of everolimus in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose disease had progressed on vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy. METHODS: Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma which had progressed on sunitinib, sorafenib, or both, were randomly assigned in a two to one ratio to receive everolimus 10 mg once daily (n=272) or placebo (n=138), in conjunction with best supportive care. Randomisation was done centrally via an interactive voice response system using a validated computer system, and was stratified by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prognostic score and previous anticancer therapy, with a permuted block size of six. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed via a blinded, independent central review. The study was designed to be terminated after 290 events of progression. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00410124. FINDINGS: All randomised patients were included in efficacy analyses. The results of the second interim analysis indicated a significant difference in efficacy between arms and the trial was thus halted early after 191 progression events had been observed (101 [37\%] events in the everolimus group, 90 [65\%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio 0.30, 95\% CI 0.22-0.40, p{$<$}0.0001; median progression-free survival 4.0 [95\% CI 3.7-5.5] vs 1.9 [1.8-1.9] months). Stomatitis (107 [40\%] patients in the everolimus group vs 11 [8\%] in the placebo group), rash (66 [25\%] vs six [4\%]), and fatigue (53 [20\%] vs 22 [16\%]) were the most commonly reported adverse events, but were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Pneumonitis (any grade) was detected in 22 (8\%) patients in the everolimus group, of whom eight had pneumonitis of grade 3 severity. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with everolimus prolongs progression-free survival relative to placebo in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that had progressed on other targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {There are only a few platforms that integrate multiple omics data types, bioinformatics tools, and interfaces for integrative analyses and visualization that do not require programming skills. Here we present iLINCS (http://ilincs.org), an integrative web-based platform for analysis of omics data and signatures of cellular perturbations. The platform facilitates mining and re-analysis of the large collection of omics datasets ({$>$}34,000), pre-computed signatures ({$>$}200,000), and their connections, as well as the analysis of user-submitted omics signatures of diseases and cellular perturbations. iLINCS analysis workflows integrate vast omics data resources and a range of analytics and interactive visualization tools into a comprehensive platform for analysis of omics signatures. iLINCS user-friendly interfaces enable execution of sophisticated analyses of omics signatures, mechanism of action analysis, and signature-driven drug repositioning. We illustrate the utility of iLINCS with three use cases involving analysis of cancer proteogenomic signatures, COVID 19 transcriptomic signatures and mTOR signaling.},

Pre-clinical studies have historically been limited to cell culture models, however, the identification of critical tumor suppressors and oncogenes from large-scale patient sequencing data has led to several new genetically engineered mouse models with phenotypes reminiscent of ccRCC. In this review, we summarize recent literature on these topics and discuss how they inform targeted therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ccRCC.},

  abstract = {The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing worldwide, and its prevalence is particularly high in some parts of Central Europe. Here we undertake whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most common form of the disease, in patients from four different European countries with contrasting disease incidence to explore the underlying genomic architecture of RCC. Our findings support previous reports on frequent aberrations in the epigenetic machinery and PI3K/mTOR signalling, and uncover novel pathways and genes affected by recurrent mutations and abnormal transcriptome patterns including focal adhesion, components of extracellular matrix (ECM) and genes encoding FAT cadherins. Furthermore, a large majority of patients from Romania have an unexpected high frequency of A:T{$>$}T:A transversions, consistent with exposure to aristolochic acid (AA). These results show that the processes underlying ccRCC tumorigenesis may vary in different populations and suggest that AA may be an important ccRCC carcinogen in Romania, a finding with major public health implications.},

  abstract = {Loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene contributes to proliferative disorders including renal cell carcinoma. The consequence of VHL loss is increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIFα), which is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the VHL gene product pVHL. HIF is a transcription factor that increases the expression of factors critical for tumorigenesis in renal cell carcinoma. We report here another regulatory component of HIFα expression in renal cancer cells. Phospholipase D (PLD), which is commonly elevated in renal and other cancers, is required for elevated levels of both HIF1α and HIF2α in VHL-deficient renal cancer cells. The induction of both HIF1α and HIF2α by hypoxic mimetic conditions was also dependent on PLD in renal cancer cells with restored pVHL expression. The effect of PLD activity upon HIFα expression was at the level of translation. PLD activity also provides a survival signal that suppresses apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in the renal cancer cells. Suppression of HIF2α has been shown to reverse tumorigenesis with renal cancer cells. The finding here that HIF2α expression is dependent on PLD in renal cancer cells suggests that targeting PLD signals may represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for targeting HIF2α in renal cancers where HIF2α is critical for tumorigenesis and elevated PLD activity is common.},

  abstract = {Background Patients with BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1)-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have worse prognosis. C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) plays an important role in ccRCC development and its expression is elevated in BAP1-mutant tumors. Methods 533 patients with ccRCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort and 797 patients with ccRCC from the Shanghai cohort were enrolled. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted with human ccRCC tumors and murine tumor models. The association between BAP1 and CCR5 or its ligands was assessed by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, real-time PCR and ELISA. Survival was compared between different subpopulations of patients using Kaplan-Meier curve. Therapeutic effect of CCR5 blockade was validated using human ccRCC tumors and murine models. Results Expression of CCR5 and its ligands were elevated in BAP1-mutant patients with ccRCC. High CCR5 expression was indicative of poor prognosis in BAP1-low group of patients. CCR5 blockade prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity of T cells and antigen presentation of dendritic cells but repressed immune checkpoint expression. CCR5 ligands could recruit CCR5+ regulatory T cells to the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, BAP1-mutant ccRCC tumor cells secreted CCR5 ligands, which increased programmed cell death ligand 1 expression. However, both processes could be inhibited by CCR5 blockade. Study limitations include the unclear impact of CCR5 expressed by other cell populations. Conclusions CCR5 in BAP1-mutant ccRCC results in an immune-suppressive microenvironment. Targeting CCR5 could provide a potential therapeutic benefit for patients. Trial registration number NCT01358721, CA209-009.},

  abstract = {Polybromo-1 (PBRM1) loss of function mutations are present in a fraction of biliary tract cancers (BTCs). PBRM1, a subunit of the PBAF chromatin-remodeling complex, is involved in DNA damage repair. Herein, we aimed to decipher the molecular landscape of PBRM1 mutated (mut) BTCs and to define potential translational aspects. Totally, 1848 BTC samples were analyzed using next-generation DNA-sequencing and immunohistochemistry (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ). siRNA-mediated knockdown of PBRM1 was performed in the BTC cell line EGI1 to assess the therapeutic vulnerabilities of ATR and PARP inhibitors in vitro. PBRM1 mutations were identified in 8.1\% (n\,=\,150) of BTCs and were more prevalent in intrahepatic BTCs (9.9\%) compared to gallbladder cancers (6.0\%) or extrahepatic BTCs (4.5\%). Higher rates of co-mutations in chromatin-remodeling genes (e.g., ARID1A 31\% vs. 16\%) and DNA damage repair genes (e.g., ATRX 4.4\% vs. 0.3\%) were detected in PBRM1-mutated (mut) vs. PBRM1-wildtype (wt) BTCs. No difference in real-world overall survival was observed between PBRM1-mut and PBRM1-wt patients (HR 1.043, 95\% CI 0.821–1.325, p\,=\,0.731). In vitro, experiments suggested that PARP ± ATR inhibitors induce synthetic lethality in the PBRM1 knockdown BTC model. Our findings served as the scientific rationale for PARP inhibition in a heavily pretreated PBRM1-mut BTC patient, which induced disease control. This study represents the largest and most extensive molecular profiling study of PBRM1-mut BTCs, which in vitro sensitizes to DNA damage repair inhibiting compounds. Our findings might serve as a rationale for future testing of PARP/ATR inhibitors in PBRM1-mut BTCs.},
